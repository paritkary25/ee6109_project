EE6109: EV Powertrain course project

This is a mathematical model of the supercapacitor hybrid battery. This takes various such inputs as the mass, specific power, specific energy of the supercapacitor and Li-ion battery, weight of the vehicle, the drive profile, etc.

The software used is matlab.

The script gives results as power usage, energy level for both the capacitor and the Li-ion battery with respect to the distances in the drive profile.
